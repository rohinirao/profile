                    <p>At Experteer, I took on the challenge of integrating multiple APIs—LinkedIn Ads, FreshDesk, MessageBird, and TalentInc—to create a seamless data flow across our systems. One of the most rewarding aspects was seeing how these integrations transformed our operations, from automating support communications to enabling real-time candidate updates and optimizing ad targeting. Each integration brought its own complexities, but solving them meant improving efficiency and delivering a smoother experience for both users and internal teams.</p>

                    <p>At Experteer, we faced a challenge—our existing Rails-based translation system couldn’t support our newer React.js and Next.js projects. Instead of rebuilding everything from scratch, I designed a custom translation module in Node.js that seamlessly connected the old system with the new. To make the process efficient, I automated the entire translation workflow. The system eliminated manual effort, streamlined the process, and ensured smooth multilingual support across all platforms.</p>

            <h3>REST API Integration Platform</h3>
            <p><span class="timeline-date">2020-2024 | Experteer</span></p>
            <p>Led the development of a complex API integrations that seamlessly connected multiple third-party services including LinkedIn Ads, FreshDesk, MessageBird and TalentInc. These Integrations streamlined data exchange processes and significantly improved system efficiency.</p>
            <p>At Experteer, I played a key role in transforming how we handled API integrations, making our systems more efficient and interconnected. One of the most impactful projects I led was the integration with TalentInc. This involved a seamless two-way communication where we sent candidate CVs/resumes to Talent's API and received detailed metadata in return. In a separate API call, we fetched CV reviews, critiques, and suggestions—enabling candidates to gain insights into their resumes. To further enhance user experience, I built a purchasing flow where candidates could buy TalentInc’s CV rewriting and other career services.
            </p><p> To ensure a smooth end-to-end process, I integrated our CRM, allowing us to initiate the TalentInc workflow via background jobs after sending the initial email from Experteer. Additionally, I implemented a Sales API integration to fetch sales details from TalentInc, ensuring our business insights remained up to date.
            </p> <p> TalentInc, I developed multiple API integrations to streamline operations. With FreshDesk, I enabled efficient support ticket management and automated email communications between our support team and users. MessageBird integration allowed us to send SMS updates to candidates and recruiters at key stages of their journey. I also built an opt-out mechanism that updated MessageBird and synced with our CRM to ensure compliance with user preferences. For LinkedIn Ads, I implemented an integration that sent candidate details to LinkedIn for targeted advertising.
            </p><p> Along with these major integrations, I developed numerous REST APIs, enhancing various workflows and ensuring smooth data exchange across different systems. This work not only improved operational efficiency but also enhanced user engagement, making the platform more intuitive and responsive.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Achievements:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed and implemented RESTful APIs, following industry best practices for scalability and maintainability</li>
                <li>Integrated Kafka for reliable message queuing and event-driven architecture</li>
                <li>Utilized ElasticSearch for efficient data indexing and fast searching capabilities</li>
                <li>Implemented Redis caching to improve response times and reduce database load</li>
                <li>Used background jobs to manage asynchronous tasks and optimize system performance</li>
                <li>Created comprehensive documentation and testing strategies to ensure platform reliability and maintainability</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Impact:</h3>
            <p>The API integration platform improved data synchronization across multiple systems, reduced manual intervention, and significantly enhanced the overall user experience. The solution processed millions of data points daily while maintaining high reliability and performance.</p>

            <h3>Custom Translation Module</h3>
            <p><span class="timeline-date">2022-2023 | Experteer</span></p>
            <p>At Experteer, we relied on in-person translators because standard i18n translations often failed to capture the nuances of European languages. Our existing translation system was designed exclusively for Rails applications, but as we expanded to newer projects built with React.js and Next.js, we needed a way to integrate them without overhauling the old system.</p>
                    <p>To solve this, I built a custom translation application in Node.js that acted as a bridge between the old and new systems. The application automated the entire translation process in multiple steps: pulling updated files from GitLab, converting JSON files into a format compatible with the existing translation system, and pushing them for translation. Once translated, it retrieved the updated texts, merged them with the existing translations, converted them back to JSON, and pushed them to the GitLab repository.</p>
                    <p> This solution allowed us to leverage the existing translation workflow while seamlessly supporting modern projects, ensuring consistency across all platforms without disrupting the established process./p> 
            
            <h3>Key Achievements:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Built a scalable translation workflow to support multiple languages and regional variations while integrating with the existing Rails-based system.</li>
                <li>Automated translation processing to optimize file conversions, updates, and synchronization, reducing manual effort. </li>
                <li>Integrated with the legacy translation system to enable seamless multilingual support for modern React.js and Next.js projects.</li>
                <li>Optimized performance by streamlining translation handling, ensuring efficient processing and reduced turnaround times.</li>
                <li>Maintained cost efficiency by leveraging the existing system without major modifications, minimizing development and operational overhead.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Impact:</h3>
            <p>The custom translation module transformed how we handled multilingual content by seamlessly integrating modern React.js and Next.js projects with our existing Rails-based system. This solution expanded our platform’s global reach, ensuring accurate translations with minimal manual effort. It enabled efficient localized content delivery, improving the experience for international users while simplifying the editorial team’s workflow. By automating the translation process, we reduced operational overhead and ensured consistency across all supported languages..</p>

            <h3>One-Click Apply for candidates</h3>
            <p><span class="timeline-date">2020-2022  | Experteer</span></p>
            <p> At Experteer, I worked on one of the most impactful features—One-Click Apply—which completely streamlined the job application process. We noticed that many potential candidates dropped off due to a lengthy onboarding process before they could even apply for a job. To solve this, I built a backend system that allowed users to apply instantly without any friction, while still ensuring recruiters received a complete candidate profile.</p>
            <p> Behind the scenes, as soon as a candidate clicked "Apply," my system took over. It automatically created an account and generated a profile based on their resume, eliminating the need for manual onboarding. To enhance their chances of landing a job, I integrated TalentInc, sending their resume for evaluation and potential improvements. At the same time, the system triggered CRM workflows to ensure smooth candidate engagement and published Kafka messages for tracking every step of the process.</p>
            <p> To maintain a strong employer brand, I developed a mechanism to generate a new resume with Experteer branding, including our logo, header, and footer. This branded resume was then used to create and submit the job application on behalf of the candidate, ensuring recruiters and headhunters received all necessary details without any extra effort from the user.</p>
            <p> Beyond just sending applications, I also implemented automated follow-ups—the system would check in with both the candidate and recruiter after a few days, keeping engagement high and improving the chances of a successful hire. To measure success, every action in the process was tracked with Google Analytics and Kafka events, allowing us to continuously optimize the flow.</p>
            <p> I led the entire backend development of this feature, collaborating closely with the UX/frontend team and product managers to create a frictionless experience. This project not only improved the application process for candidates but also helped recruiters connect with actively interested job seekers more efficiently.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Achievements:</h3>
