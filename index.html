                  <h2 class="section-title">Who I Am</h2>
                  <p>Hello! I'm Rohini Ramakrishna, a Senior Software Developer with over 10 years of experience in creating robust, scalable solutions across various domains. Based in Munich, Germany, I specialize in Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, and cloud-based technologies.</p>
                  
                  <p>My journey in software development began in 2008, and since then, I've worked on a diverse range of projects including B2B platforms, cloud infrastructure, loan management systems, Payroll and time management applications. I'm passionate about building clean, maintainable code and creating solutions that solve real business problems.</p>
                  
                  <p>What drives me is the opportunity to transform complex requirements into elegant, user-friendly applications. I enjoy the challenge of optimizing performance, enhancing scalability, and ensuring reliability in the systems I develop.</p>
                  
                  <h2 class="section-title">My Approach</h2>
                  <p>I believe in a thoughtful, collaborative approach to software development, where every project begins with a deep understanding of requirements and business goals. I value clean code, test-driven development, and continuous integration to ensure quality and maintainability.</p>      
                  <p>Throughout my career, I've worked with various Agile methodologies, collaborating with Agile coaches, Scrum Masters, Product Owners, and Project Managers across different companies. This experience has shown me that Agile works—but finding the right approach is key. The best Agile framework depends on the team dynamics, project scope, and company culture rather than strictly following every rule. I’m comfortable adapting to different Agile workflows while ensuring efficiency and collaboration.</p>
                  <p>I take ownership and accountability for the features and projects I work on, ensuring they are successfully completed. At the same time, I thrive in team environments, working closely with fellow developers, product managers, and designers. I enjoy code reviews and technical discussions, always open to exploring different perspectives without ego. While I have strong opinions, I believe professional work should be about the best solution, not personal preferences.</p>
                  <p>I firmly follow fundamental software principles like KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), and SOLID. My philosophy prioritizes readability, where variable names, methods, and class names should make code as understandable as natural language. While comments are valuable for complex logic, I believe that well-written code should largely speak for itself.</p>
                  <p>Testing and documentation are at the core of my workflow. Unit testing boosts confidence in the code and simplifies debugging, especially in edge cases. I also believe in writing documentation throughout the development process, not as an afterthought.</p>
                  <p>When it comes to professional growth, I recognize my strengths—adaptability and accountability—as well as areas for improvement. I sometimes struggle with saying ‘no’ and overcommitting, but I am continuously working to balance enthusiasm with realistic commitments.</p>
